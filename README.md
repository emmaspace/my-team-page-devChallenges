## Overview

This project has a very interesting layout in the desktop design as well as in the mobile design which was a little challenging to approach at first but while doing so, it helped me practice and understand come CSS details I had overlooked before. This way, I consolidated a better understanding of CSS and how to approach a responsive design. 

I also learned how to manage pseudo-classes in an effective way and how the elements change their behavior depending on styling details.

This also helped me learn and understand how psotioning works in CSS, so I learned how to used these different properties correctly.
